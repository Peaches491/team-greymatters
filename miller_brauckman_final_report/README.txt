Abstract:
  Robot-assisted neurosurgery performed within the confines of an MRI scanner can provide numerous benefits for both the patient and the surgeon. The surgeon can view progress in real time, ensuring a high degree of accuracy and control, decreasing procedure duration, and reducing the frequency of errors. In this paper, we  calculate the forward and inverse kinematics for the 7 DOF RCM manipulator, and to customize the arm's linkages to best fit a given patient and operation. These optimized linkage configurations will provide some mechanical collision avoidance, while guaranteeing full access to the surgical site.
